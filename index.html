  <h2>Selected Projects</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Early Prediction of Student Success in School Systems:</strong>
      Developed a predictive model to identify students at risk of academic underperformance using early indicators from educational data.<br />
      <em>Tools:</em> Python, pandas, scikit-learn | <em>Skills:</em> Data Cleaning, Logistic Regression, Predictive Modeling<br />
      Cleaned and preprocessed student-level data including attendance, grades, and demographics. Handled missing values and encoded categorical variables.<br />
      Trained and evaluated logistic regression models to predict academic outcomes based on early semester data.<br />
      Identified key risk factors and provided interpretable model outputs to support early intervention strategies for educators and administrators.
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <strong>Mental Health Data Analysis Using R:</strong>
      Analyzed CDC’s 2021 BRFSS Survey Data to explore the relationship between mental health days, education, gender, and insurance type.<br />
      <em>Tools:</em> R, Tidyverse, ggplot2 | <em>Skills:</em> Data Cleaning, EDA, Linear Regression<br />
      Cleaned and recoded variables, removed invalid responses and outliers. Visualized distributions and relationships using ggplot2.<br />
      Built multiple linear regression models and selected the final model using Adjusted R² and AIC. Key predictors included gender and insurance type.<br />
      Findings revealed socioeconomic disparities in reported mental health.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Mushroom Classification Using Neural Networks & PCA:</strong>
      Built a deep learning model to classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous based on a variety of categorical features.<br />
      <em>Tools:</em> Python, TensorFlow, scikit-learn | <em>Skills:</em> Neural Networks, Dimensionality Reduction, Model Evaluation<br />
      Preprocessed the dataset by encoding features and applied PCA for dimensionality reduction. Trained multiple neural network models.<br />
      Compared performance across models with and without PCA using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.<br />
      Demonstrated the impact of feature selection on classification accuracy and explained model decisions.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Facial Recognition System:</strong>
      Developed a facial recognition application using computer vision techniques as part of an Applied Machine Learning course.<br />
      <em>Tools:</em> Python, OpenCV, Keras | <em>Skills:</em> CNNs, Image Preprocessing, Feature Extraction<br />
      Implemented convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract features and identify individuals from a custom dataset.<br />
      Applied data augmentation and face alignment to improve recognition accuracy.<br />
      Evaluated performance across different lighting conditions and facial expressions to test robustness.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Tableau Sales Channel Dashboard:</strong>
      Designed and deployed an interactive Tableau dashboard to analyze performance across various sales channels.<br />
      <em>Tools:</em> Tableau | <em>Skills:</em> KPI Development, Data Storytelling, Dashboard Design<br />
      Created a storyboard that highlighted key metrics, including cost, revenue, and trends in sales by channel.<br />
      Discovered that in-store sales were highest performing but on a decline, while online sales were gaining traction but were more costly.<br />
      Provided actionable insights and visualized trade-offs between channel growth and efficiency.
